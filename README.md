## Known issues:
1. Mac comes with pre installed Ruby which is few versions behind. You may need to install ruby separately and modify PATH variable. 
(If you haven't upgraded your mac os for a while, you will be stuck forever.)

2. Bundler 2 isn't production ready. You may face the issue mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54063318/bundler-2-0-1-installed-rails-says-must-use-bundler-2-or-greater
